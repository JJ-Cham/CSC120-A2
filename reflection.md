What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    What worked for the computer class was utlizing what the return in the procedural for the computer as a guide for the elements that needed to be initialized for the computer class. 

    What didn't work was treating the classes as python, I tried to have them be equal to one another with their names only but that did not work. I had to use the command self to initialize the elements. 

    Advice that I would give someone taking this course in the future is to know or brief yourself on Java/Python syntax beforehand. I would also suggest watching the video a few times because I picked up on few more helpful things when I did. And going to office hours was a tremendous help.
